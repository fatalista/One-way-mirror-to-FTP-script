# One-way-mirror-to-FTP-script
One way mirroring of a folder to another folder on FTP server. Made using Python's ftplib.

Script copies all contents of the folder it's in to a folder on the FTP. You can specify your FTP in the code of the script.
- You need to insert username, password, host address and the path on your FTP server where you want to mirror your files.
- I tested with folders, images and .py files. No further testing has been done. Might have bugs.
- Comments are in Slovak.
